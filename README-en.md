typist but cheater :) <br>
# what is this?<br>
One day in our computer class, the teacher gave a typing test and my typing speed was 16 due to stress.<br>
I was upset and then I wrote this program to say that this is the speed of my mind :)<br>

## What does this program do?

1. This getinfo function takes your information, this is the email and password you have registered <br>
on https://typetest.io/ and it is entered into your account with this information :) <br>

2. This log in function is entered into your account so that the points are registered for you on the site

3. The start_type function takes the text from the site and sends it to the same entry that is on the site. As if you were typing

### Install this to run <br>

  ```
  pip install selenium
  ```
